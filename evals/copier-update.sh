# (Milestone 7 acceptance gate, SPEC §7). It instantiates the harness with Copier,
# makes a template change, runs `copier update`, and asserts the change was
# re-applied to the already-instantiated harness — the capability that
# distinguishes Copier from a snapshot template engine.
#
# Requires: copier (pipx install copier) and git. If copier is absent the script
# exits non-zero with an install hint (the milestone genuinely depends on it).

# Template-only gate. Propagation is a capability of the TEMPLATE; an instance is
# the OUTPUT of propagation, not a propagator. In an instantiated harness copier.yml
# and the .jinja sources have been rendered away at generation, so there is no
# template machinery to exercise — skip cleanly. In the template copier.yml is
# tracked, so this guard is a no-op and the full gate runs. (Kept byte-identical
# template-and-instance so `copier update` never conflicts on this file.)
#
# Skip ONLY when affirmatively in an instance: a git work tree where copier.yml is
# untracked. Outside a git work tree (no git, or a source tarball) we must NOT skip
# — the script genuinely requires git (it runs `git ls-files`/`git init` below), so
# it should fail loudly with that requirement rather than silently pass having
# exercised nothing.
