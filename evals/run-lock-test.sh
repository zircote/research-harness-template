# The lock is the mutual-exclusion guard that prevents two concurrent runs from
# corrupting one topic's shared findings/ (the documented CONCURRENCY INCIDENT:
# 10 verification blocks stripped, 2 findings deleted). This pins its contract:
#   - a second concurrent acquire on a held topic is DENIED (exit 3);
#   - release frees the topic for the next run;
#   - a STALE lock (crashed run) is stolen so the topic never wedges;
#   - refresh keeps a held lock alive.
#
# Exit 0 = the lock contract holds. Exit 1 = a case failed.
