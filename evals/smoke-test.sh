# Engine smoke test (Milestone 3 acceptance gate, SPEC §6b).
#
# Exercises the deterministic substrate the engine agents drive: it runs the
# orchestrator pipeline toward the sample session goal on a fixture, runs the
# adversarial falsification gate EXACTLY ONCE, and emits a finding that validates
# against the MIF-backed findings schema. The agent .md files document the
# LLM-driven behaviour; this test pins the contracts and gate scripts they rely
# on, so the engine is verifiable offline and in CI.
#
# Exit 0 = the engine pipeline is sound. Exit 1 = a stage failed.
