# Research Harness

One distributable template repository that a user clones (or instantiates with
Copier) to get a complete, self-contained research harness: the orchestration
engine, the methodology skills, the workflows, the contracts, the knowledge
graph, multi-topic support, and the research→blog and research→book output
pipelines — all in one package.

## Status

This template is evolving and should not be considered stable. Interfaces,
schemas and pack contracts may change between releases.

It is also a primary tool in the author's daily workflow, and it is maintained
with corresponding care. Changes will favor backward compatibility, and every
reasonable effort will go toward minimizing disruption for existing clones.
Breaking changes will be recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and reflected
in the version.

## Layout

The repository has four layers, all present on clone (design spec §5):

1. **Engine** — `.claude/agents/` orchestrator + dimension-analyst +
   falsification-analyst + source-chunker + report-synthesizer, and the
   `.claude/commands/` that delegate to them.
2. **Contracts** — `schemas/`: the MIF-backed findings schema, the
   `harness.config.json` manifest schema, the pack contract, and the
   Structured Data Protocol.
3. **Harness services** — multi-topic registry, knowledge graph, search,
   discovery, reindex — operating directly on the MIF substrate.
4. **Outputs** — the generic `report` channel is the canonical MIF Level-3 source
   of truth (`reports/<topic>/<slug>.md`); blog is the first-class published
   projection; book, other channels, and all deliverable genres arrive as optional
   **plugins** — one per skill under `packs/<family>/<skill>/`, enabled selectively
   (see [docs/explanation/pack-structure.md](docs/explanation/pack-structure.md)).
   All information in and out of the harness is MIF (see
   [docs/explanation/mif-io-conformance.md](docs/explanation/mif-io-conformance.md)).
   Findings are typed against per-topic ontologies (an always-on generic core plus
   optional domain ontology packs), enforced deterministically — see
   [docs/explanation/ontology-conformance.md](docs/explanation/ontology-conformance.md).
   Those types compose into a unified, fail-closed cross-topic **concordance** (the
   ontological spine) — see
   [docs/explanation/ontological-spine.md](docs/explanation/ontological-spine.md).

Cross-cutting: bundled enforcement hooks (`.claude/hooks/`), bundled docs
(`docs/`, Diataxis), and `evals/`.

## The one file you edit

`harness.config.json` is the deploy contract: it declares your topics, research
dimensions, output targets, which packs are enabled, and the `site` projection. It
is validated by `harness.config.schema.json`.

## Reading your reports

The bundled Astro/Starlight site renders `reports/` (and the Diátaxis `docs/`) for
human reading — `npm install && npm run dev`. A clone is activated reports-primary
at instantiation; flip the leading surface or toggle optional site plugins with
`scripts/site-toggle.sh` (or ask `/configure`). See
[How to configure the reports site](docs/how-to/configure-the-site.md).

## Quality gate

`bash scripts/verify.sh` runs the full build gate (schema validation, the
citation-integrity gate, and each milestone's acceptance gate).
`markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"` must report zero errors. Both run in CI on every
push and pull request. Toolchain: `jq` and `yq` (the YAML analog of jq, used by
the MIF report projector), `ajv-cli` + `ajv-formats`, and `copier` for the
distribution gate.

## Supply-chain verification

Every dependency or tool the harness downloads is cryptographically verified, via
a waterfall: prefer a GitHub build-provenance attestation (`gh attestation
verify`); when upstream publishes none, relax to the minimum — a pinned version
plus a SHA-256 cross-checked against the upstream signed `checksums`. A
verification miss fails the build; nothing installs unverified. Package-manager
installs (`npm`, `pip`/`pipx`) are integrity-verified against the registry by the
manager itself. The raw `yq` binary is downloaded with this waterfall in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` (yq publishes no attestation, so it lands on the
pinned-SHA-256 floor).
