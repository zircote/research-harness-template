# publish-report — research → canonical MIF Level-3 report

The generic `report` channel is the **canonical MIF Level-3 source of truth**
(SPEC §10): a basic markdown report (`reports/<topic>/<slug>.md`) with authoritative
YAML frontmatter (the MIF concept) over a Markdown body. Unlike the `blog` and
`book` projections — which are MIF-exempt published prose — the report is **never
exempt**: it is held to the **same L3 bar as a finding** and must carry a real,
non-falsified `extensions.harness.verification` verdict before it ships.

## Pipeline

1. **Resolve the finding set.** Default to the topic's findings dir
   (`reports/<topic>/findings/`). Only **surviving** findings (verdict ≠
   `falsified`) are eligible.

2. **Synthesize the artifact** (full MIF citations carried through):

   ```bash
   scripts/synthesize-artifact.sh reports/<topic>/findings <genre> reports/<topic>/artifact.json
   ```

3. **Obtain a REAL verdict — never author it by hand.** Run the same adversarial
   falsification gate a finding goes through over the synthesised report's claims,
   and extract the verdict block it writes:

   ```bash
   # report-finding.json = a finding-shaped projection of the report's central
   # claims (its citations, no verification block yet).
   scripts/falsify.sh reports/<topic>/report-finding.json <evidence> \
     > reports/<topic>/report-finding.falsified.json
   jq '.extensions.harness.verification' reports/<topic>/report-finding.falsified.json \
     > reports/<topic>/report.verification.json
   ```

   A `falsified` verdict means the report is quarantined and NOT shipped.

4. **Render the report** (write-then-validated; fails closed if it does not project
   to a valid L3 finding):

   ```bash
   scripts/render-artifact.sh reports/<topic>/artifact.json report \
     reports/<topic>/<slug>.md reports/<topic>/report.verification.json
   ```

5. **Confirm L3.** `scripts/render-artifact.sh` already validates via
   `scripts/mif-project.sh`; before reporting done, re-run it to be sure:

   ```bash
   scripts/mif-project.sh reports/<topic>/<slug>.md
   ```

6. **Reconcile the topic README.** Rendering the report wrote
   `reports/<topic>/<slug>.md` through the shell, which the README PostToolUse
   hook never observes — so the navigation README's Reports table and counts are
   now stale. Deterministically rebuild it (build mode preserves authored
   Purpose / Key Findings prose; idempotent):

   ```bash
   bash scripts/build-topic-readme.sh <topic>
   ```

## Non-negotiables

- **Never hand-author the verification verdict.** It must come from a real
  falsification pass, exactly as for a finding. The gate enforces that a
  well-formed, non-`falsified` verdict is *present*; that it was honestly earned
  rests on you.
- **Never ship a falsified or quarantined report.** `mif-project.sh` and the
  citation-integrity gate reject a `falsified` verdict.
- **The report is the MIF source of truth, not exempt.** The title lives in the
  frontmatter; the body carries no top-level heading (it would trip MD025 and
  duplicate the title). To change content, change the findings or the synthesis,
  not the rendered Markdown in place.
- **Genres are L3 here.** A genre shapes the report's content; the report is still
  rendered through this channel and held to L3.
