# render-artifact.sh — render one typed Artifact (schemas/artifact.schema.json)
# to a first-class output channel (SPEC §6d). Blog and book are the always-on
# first-class channels; both consume the SAME artifact contract, which is the
# point of the typed findings->artifact seam — research and publication ship as
# one system and the citation gates run uniformly across every output.
#
# Published prose is written from the artifact's synthesized body + public
# citations only; it carries no internal finding ids or corpus paths, so the
# citation-leak gate stays green.
#
# Usage: render-artifact.sh <artifact.json> <blog|book> <out.md>
