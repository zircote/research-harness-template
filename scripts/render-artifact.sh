# render-artifact.sh — render one typed Artifact (schemas/artifact.schema.json)
# to an output channel (SPEC §6d, §10). Three channels:
#   report — the generic MIF Level-3 markdown report (reports/<topic>/<slug>.md):
#            authoritative YAML frontmatter (the MIF concept) + Markdown body.
#            This is the canonical MIF source of truth and is NEVER exempt; it is
#            write-then-validated through scripts/mif-project.sh. A real
#            falsification verdict (extensions.harness.verification) is REQUIRED,
#            so the falsification gate must run over the synthesised claims BEFORE
#            rendering — pass the resulting verdict as <verification.json>.
#   blog — the first-class PUBLISHED channel; book + channel packs — optional PUBLISHED
#            channels. blog and book now carry MIF **Level-1** frontmatter (a base
#            concept: @context/@type/@id/conceptType/created) — the doc's own
#            identity — so every report output is at least L1 (the report channel is
#            full L3). They remain exempt from the L3 I/O conformance gate (their
#            FORMAT is orthogonal): prose is written from the artifact's synthesised
#            body + public citations only and carries no internal finding identity,
#            so the citation-leak gate stays green.
#
# EXHAUSTIVE by contract: the synthesizer emits one section per surviving finding
# and carries each finding's own evidence (sources, entities, dimension, verdict)
# onto its section, so every channel renders every finding WITH its evidence — the
# same per-finding rigor the diataxis channel performs, not a thin summary.
#
# Usage: render-artifact.sh <artifact.json> <report|blog|book> <out.md> [<verification.json>]
