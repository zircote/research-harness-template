# run-lock.sh — topic-level mutual-exclusion lock for a research run.
#
# WHY: a topic's findings live in one shared directory (reports/<topic>/findings/).
# Two pipelines running concurrently on the SAME topic corrupt each other — the
# documented CONCURRENCY INCIDENT stripped the verification block from 10 findings
# and DELETED 2 findings (no backup recoverable). The root cause was multiple
# independent runs writing one topic's findings/ at once. Every entry point that
# MUTATES a topic's findings — the orchestrator (any mode) and the standalone
# /falsify gate — acquires this lock first, so a second concurrent run on the same
# topic REFUSES to start rather than racing the live writer.
#
# This mirrors the .gate-active phase marker: an atomically-created marker whose
# freshness (mtime) ages out, so a CRASHED run does not wedge the topic forever —
# a later run steals a stale lock. A LIVE run refreshes the lock at each phase
# boundary so it never ages out underneath it.
#
# The lock is a DIRECTORY: `mkdir` is an atomic test-and-set across processes
# (`touch` is not — it always succeeds and cannot detect a prior holder). Freshness
# is the directory's mtime; an `owner` file inside records a human-readable label
# for the diagnostic message.
#
# Staleness window: RUN_LOCK_STALE_MIN (default 240 = 4h). 240 is chosen to match
# the gate window's fixed `-mmin -240` (.gate-active), but that hook window is NOT
# env-tunable — so if you raise RUN_LOCK_STALE_MIN, keep it >= 240; lowering it
# shortens crash self-heal but risks a long phase aging the lock out mid-run. A live
# run MUST refresh within this window at every phase boundary or risk being stolen.
#
# Usage:
#   run-lock.sh acquire <reports_dir> [label]   # exit 0 acquired (or stole stale); 3 held by live run / lost steal race; 2 usage
#   run-lock.sh refresh <reports_dir>           # touch a HELD lock; no-op if it is already gone (never resurrects)
#   run-lock.sh release <reports_dir>           # drop the lock
#   run-lock.sh steal   <reports_dir> [label]   # force re-acquire (recovery; e.g. operator-driven /resume)
set -uo pipefail
STALE_MIN="${RUN_LOCK_STALE_MIN:-240}"
# Validate: an empty/non-numeric/zero value would make `find -mmin` error and fresh()
# mis-judge a LIVE lock as stale (then steal it — the corruption this prevents). Fall
# back to the safe default rather than fail open.
