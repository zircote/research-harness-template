# One-time remediation for reports rendered BEFORE render-artifact.sh started
# stamping `slug:`/`version:` frontmatter (see that script's SLUGPATH/VERSION
# comments): the site's cross-link rewriter (astro-rehype-relative-markdown-
# links) slugifies path segments with github-slugger, a HEADING-anchor
# algorithm that strips embedded "." without inserting a separator. Any
# genre-suffixed filename ("<slug>.<genre>.md") rendered before that fix
# therefore has a mismatched, 404ing rewritten href on the served site, even
# though Astro's own content-collection route (which keeps the dot) resolves
# fine. The plugin honors an explicit `slug:` frontmatter field over its own
# computation, so this backfills one — plus `version: 1`, since a file already
# on disk with no version field is, by definition, the only known revision.
#
# Idempotent: a file that already carries a `slug:` (or `version:`) key is left
# untouched. Only touches files with real YAML frontmatter (a leading `---`
# line) — plain-markdown deliverables (research-progress.md, falsification
# reports) have no frontmatter and are skipped automatically.
#
# Usage: backfill-report-slugs.sh [--dry-run] [<topic> ...]
#        no <topic> args = every reports/<topic> directory (excluding _meta).
