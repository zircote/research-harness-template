# check-version-bump.sh — enforce change-driven versioning (ADR-0010) in CI.
#
# The companion to scripts/bump-version.sh: that tool MAKES the version mutations,
# this gate PROVES they happened. It diffs the working ref against a base and fails
# when something changed but its version did not move:
#
#   - a changed pack (packs/<family>/<component>/**) whose plugin.json .version is
#     unchanged from the base,
#   - a changed core skill (.claude/skills/<name>/**) whose SKILL.md `version:` is
#     unchanged from the base,
#   - ANY tracked change at all while harness.config.json .version (the single
#     release pointer) stayed put.
#
# Independently-versioned ontology packs (packs/ontologies/**, schemas/ontologies/**)
# are exempt — they carry their own version on their own cadence.
#
# Escape hatch: put `[skip-version-check]` on its OWN LINE in a PR commit message
# for a change that genuinely warrants no release (it bypasses the pointer rule
# only; a changed pack/skill must still bump, since that is never a no-op).
#
# Usage:
#   check-version-bump.sh [BASE_REF]      # BASE_REF default: $BASE_REF env, else origin/main
#
# Requires git history for BASE_REF (CI must check out with fetch-depth: 0 and fetch
# the base branch). Run from the repository root.

# Escape hatch for the release-pointer rule. Two things make the match robust:
#  - Scan the PR commit RANGE, not HEAD: on a pull_request CI checks out the merge
#    commit, so HEAD's message is the auto-generated "Merge ..."; the contributor's
#    marker lives in BASE..HEAD (the PR's own commits), found in CI and locally.
#  - Require the marker ALONE on a line (grep -x), so merely *mentioning*
#    `[skip-version-check]` in prose (a commit that documents the hatch) does not
#    trip it — only an intentional standalone marker line does.
