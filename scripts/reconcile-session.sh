# reconcile-session.sh — derive a durable session checkpoint
# (reports/<topic>/state.json) purely from disk and print the remaining-work plan.
# Crash-safe resume (SPEC §6b): a finding is DONE iff it validates against
# schemas/findings.schema.json — which REQUIRES extensions.harness.verification
# (verdict + verdict_basis), so a valid finding has already been through the
# falsification gate. Raw/partial/invalid findings and *.tmp / hidden partial
# writes are EXCLUDED from done-counts, so /resume never reworks a completed
# finding (re-running burns expensive web research + falsification budget).
#
# A finding is found WHEREVER it lives: the canonical reports/<topic>/findings/
# subdir AND, defensively, a flat reports/<topic>/finding-*.json — a real finding
# must never be missed, or its dimension would be re-run from scratch.
#
# Idempotent and byte-deterministic: no wall-clock field, sorted records, jq -S.
#
# Usage: reconcile-session.sh <reports-dir>
#   writes <reports-dir>/state.json; prints the remaining plan to stdout; exit 0.
