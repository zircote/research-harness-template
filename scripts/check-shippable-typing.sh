# check-shippable-typing.sh — fail-closed pre-synthesis gate (ADR-0011). A finding that
# SHIPS (extensions.harness.verification.verdict in survived|weakened) MUST resolve to a
# valid ontology type. Untyped/unresolved/invalid/missing-from-map shippable findings BLOCK
# synthesis (exit 1); an UNPARSEABLE finding file also blocks (its verdict/type are
# unknowable — fail closed). Falsified/quarantined/inconclusive never block. Read-only.
#
# This covers the gap validate-concordance.sh structurally cannot see: a concept node for an
# untyped finding gets entityType:null (build-concordance.sh), and validate-concordance.sh
# filters `entityType != null`, so an untyped shippable finding passes the spine validator
# VACUOUSLY. This gate refuses to SHIP such a finding.
#
# Usage: check-shippable-typing.sh <reports-dir>     # e.g. reports/<topic>
#   exit 0 = all shippable findings carry a valid ontology type
#   exit 1 = one or more shippable findings are untyped/unresolved/invalid (synthesis BLOCKED)
#   exit 2 = no findings dir ; exit 3 = ontology-map.json missing (cannot prove typing)
