#
# Fail-closed provenance gate in FRONT of `copier update` (issue #94). Copier
# exposes no pre-fetch hook and runs template `_tasks`/`_migrations` under
# `--trust`, so the gate must run BEFORE Copier is ever invoked, and the update
# must be PINNED to the exact commit the gate verified (no floating "latest").
#
# Trust model — reuses the EXACT primitive of .github/workflows/release.yml,
# SECURITY.md, and CI (one verification primitive everywhere):
#   1. Resolve the target tag and pin it to a concrete commit SHA.
#   2. Reproduce the release artifact from that tree, byte-for-byte the way
#      release.yml builds it: `git archive --format=tar --prefix=<name>-<tag>/ \
#      <sha> | gzip -n`.
#   3. Verify its SLSA build-provenance attestation, pinned to THIS repo AND the
#      release workflow identity:
#        gh attestation verify <artifact> --repo <owner/repo> \
#          --signer-workflow <owner/repo>/.github/workflows/release.yml
#      Any miss -> non-zero exit, Copier is NEVER invoked.
#   4. On success: `copier update --vcs-ref <verified-sha>` — Copier checks out
#      exactly the verified SHA (closes the TOCTOU gap; a git SHA is a content
#      hash, so the checkout is the verified bytes by construction).
#
# The pinned trust root is the `--signer-workflow` identity baked into THIS file.
# update.sh is template-managed, so a hostile update could rewrite it — but the
# CURRENT (trusted) update.sh verifies the incoming tag against the current pinned
# identity BEFORE applying it, so an update not signed by the release workflow is
# rejected before it can replace the verifier. The root is established once at
# clone (TOFU) and cannot be silently weakened by an update.
#
# Reproducibility note: `git archive | gzip -n` is deterministic for a given git
# version + platform, but tar header format and the gzip OS byte can differ across
# platforms (release.yml documents the same caveat). If verification fails ONLY
# because your local toolchain produces different bytes, that is a reproducibility
# mismatch, not a provenance failure — see docs/how-to/update-your-harness.md.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/update.sh [--target <tag>] [-- <extra copier args>]
#   exit 0 = verified and applied; non-zero = verification miss / precondition
#   failure (nothing applied).
