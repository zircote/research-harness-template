"""Deterministic JSON emitter for harness authoring models.

The emitted JSON is the contract. Agents build a typed dict (see the generated
``harness_models.<schema>`` modules) and call :func:`dump_json` / :func:`write`
instead of hand-composing JSON in the shell — eliminating the ``jq -n`` / ``eval``
quoting footgun. ``json`` guarantees syntactically valid output; this module pins
the *canonical form* so the same logical content always produces byte-identical
bytes:

* keys sorted lexicographically (object key order is semantically irrelevant to
  the schema, so a stable order is chosen for the contract),
* two-space indent, UTF-8 preserved (``ensure_ascii=False``),
* exactly one trailing newline.

**Values are emitted faithfully — nothing is dropped.** The models mark optional
fields ``NotRequired``: to omit one, leave the key out of the dict entirely. A
``None`` that is present is intentional and serializes as ``null`` (some fields,
e.g. ``session-state`` ``attempted_at``, are *required and nullable* — dropping
their ``null`` would make the contract invalid). ajv is the validity gate that
catches a ``null`` placed where the schema forbids it. Array order is preserved.
Pure stdlib.
