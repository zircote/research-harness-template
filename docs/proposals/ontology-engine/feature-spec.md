# Compiled Ontology Engine Proof-of-Concept (CLI + MCP)

## Overview

`scripts/ontology-review.sh` and `scripts/resolve-ontology.sh` review and
classify MIF findings against domain ontologies by spawning `yq`, `jq`, and
`ajv` as separate subprocesses per finding — measured at 20+ minutes for a
real 4296-finding corpus. This feature builds a compiled proof-of-concept
engine that reimplements exactly the observable behavior of that pair
(including the `--followup` backlog and STAMPED/DISCOVERY/UNTYPED/INVALID
coverage split from research-harness-template#251), as a CLI (drop-in for
existing callers) and an MCP server (`search`, `suggest_type`, `find_similar`,
`corpus_stats`). Scope is exactly this one pair — not the harness's other
bash scripts (see `docs/adr/0014-compiled-ontology-engine-cli-and-mcp.md` for
why the scope stops here) — and the bash scripts remain the reference
implementation and fallback throughout this proof-of-concept phase.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When the engine's `review` subcommand runs against a synthetic fixture
   corpus of at least 4296 findings across 36 topics (generated to match the
   scale of the real corpus used for this session's measurement,
   `~/Projects/zircote/research-harness`, since that corpus is a private path
   not vendored into this repo and unreachable by CI or a future
   implementer), it shall complete in under 5 minutes. The real corpus
   remains the out-of-band reference measurement this bound was derived from,
   verified by the author, not a CI-enforceable input.
2. When any of the 144 `scripts/verify.sh` assertions or 41
   `evals/run-evals.sh` evals that currently invoke
   `scripts/ontology-review.sh` or `scripts/resolve-ontology.sh` are
   re-pointed at the engine's CLI with no other change, they shall pass with
   identical outcomes — same exit codes, same stdout table/summary format,
   same `--followup` backlog JSON shape.
3. When an agent calls the `find_similar` MCP tool with a finding's content,
   the engine shall return results ranked by similarity score.
4. When an agent calls the `find_similar` MCP tool with a finding's content,
   the engine shall not restrict results to the querying finding's own topic.
5. When an agent calls the `find_similar` MCP tool with a finding's content,
   the engine shall include each result's topic and `finding_id`.
6. When an agent calls the `suggest_type` MCP tool, the engine shall return
   ranked candidate entity types with similarity scores.
7. When an agent calls the `suggest_type` MCP tool, the engine shall not
   write anything to any finding file — the MCP server process shall have no
   write access to `reports/`.
8. If the engine binary is missing or fails to start, then the existing bash
   scripts shall continue to operate correctly with no change in behavior —
   this proof-of-concept introduces no hard dependency.
9. If two engine invocations are started against the same corpus
   concurrently, then the second invocation shall fail closed with a clear
   "another review is in progress" error rather than proceeding to write.

## Design

- **CLI subcommands** mirror today's flags exactly, so callers change only
  the binary name:
  - `<engine> review [--topic <id>] [--strict] [--reports-dir <p>] [--config <p>] [--catalog <p>] [--followup <path>]`
  - `<engine> resolve <finding.json> [--topic <id>] [--catalog <p>] [--config <p>] [--map <path>]`
- **Index build**: `<engine> review` builds/refreshes a full-text index
  (over each finding's content fields) and a flat embedding store, as a
  derived, gitignored artifact analogous to `ontology-map.json` but instance-
  local and not committed — e.g. `reports/_meta/search-index.sqlite` and
  `reports/_meta/embeddings.bin`. Rebuilding is the same operation as today's
  "rebuild deterministically from disk" pattern (`ontology-review.sh`'s own
  comment), just against a persistent index instead of a JSON file per topic.
- **Lock file**: `<engine> review` acquires an exclusive lock (e.g.
  `reports/_meta/.review.lock`) for the duration of the run and fails closed
  if it cannot acquire it — the exact concurrency gap this session hit by
  accident, running two `ontology-review.sh` processes in parallel and
  corrupting derived `ontology-map.json` files with no lock to prevent it.
- **MCP server** reads the same index the CLI builds:
  - `search(query: string, limit?: number) -> [{finding_id, topic, snippet, score}]`
    — full-text query.
  - `suggest_type(text: string, topic: string, limit?: number) -> [{entity_type, ontology_id, score}]`
    — embedding similarity against each bound ontology's entity-type
    descriptions; a hypothesis for the `/ontology-review --enrich`
    retro-classification step to confirm, never an auto-write.
  - `find_similar(text: string, limit?: number, exclude_finding_id?: string) -> [{finding_id, topic, score}]`
    — embedding similarity across every topic in the corpus, addressing the
    "has this already been found" gap from the PRD.
  - `corpus_stats() -> {topics: N, findings: N, stamped: N, discovery: N, untyped: N, invalid: N}`
    — the same aggregate `ontology-review.sh`'s summary line reports today,
    read from the index instead of a fresh scan.
  - If the index does not exist (fresh clone, engine never run), every MCP
    tool returns a clear `"index not built — run <engine> review first"`
    error, never an empty/silent result that could be misread as "nothing
    found."

## Edge Cases

- **Zero-finding corpus (fresh instance)**: `<engine> review` produces the
  same "0 topics" output the bash script produces today, and still builds an
  (empty) index as part of that run. Once that empty index exists, every MCP
  tool returns an empty result set, not an error — this is distinct from the
  "index not built" case below, which is about the index never having been
  built at all, not the index being built and legitimately empty.
- **A finding file that fails to parse (invalid JSON)**: the CLI path
  matches today's fail-closed behavior exactly — counted as invalid/gap,
  never silently skipped. The index-build path skips it from the index with
  a logged warning and continues building the rest of the index; it must not
  abort the whole build over one bad file.
- **Concurrent `<engine> review` invocations on the same corpus**: the second
  invocation fails closed on the lock file with a clear error naming the
  in-progress run, rather than racing to write the same index/map files (the
  exact corruption this session caused by accident with the bash scripts,
  which have no such lock).
- **Engine binary missing or crashes on startup**: existing bash-script
  callers (`.claude/commands/`, `.claude/agents/`, `scripts/verify.sh`,
  `evals/run-evals.sh`) continue working unmodified — this proof-of-concept
  phase introduces no hard dependency on the engine existing.
- **`suggest_type`/`find_similar` called before any index exists**: returns
  the "index not built" error described above, not a stale or empty
  false-negative result.
