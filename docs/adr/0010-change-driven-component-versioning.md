# ADR-0010: Change-driven component versioning

## Status

Accepted

## Context

### Background and Problem Statement

The harness ships ~80 versioned artifacts: `harness.config.json`, the marketplace
catalog (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`), every core skill's `SKILL.md`
frontmatter, and — for each pack — a `plugin.json`, a `SKILL.md`, and a
`**Version:**` row in its family reference doc under `docs/reference/packs/`.

Until this decision, a release used **lockstep stamping**: every one of those
artifacts was rewritten to the new release number on every release, whether or
not the artifact had changed. The procedure was manual — `CLAUDE.md` instructed
the author to "mirror the previous bump commit" and change all of them together,
with no tool — and `CLAUDE.md` also asserted that a verify gate "fails if any
stamp drifts from `harness.config`." That gate did not exist: `scripts/verify.sh`
only checked that a `version:` field is *present* (gate 2c-fm), never that it
*equals* the release.

### Current Limitations

- **A patch release rewrites ~80 files to assert a change that did not happen.**
  A version number is supposed to mean "this component changed." Bumping 70
  unchanged packs from `0.4.2` to `0.4.3` makes the number lie and makes the diff
  unreviewable — the real change (e.g. a README image) drowns in stamp noise.
- **Every stamp edit is a corruption opportunity.** A hand-run sweep across 80
  files can truncate a JSON value, miss the marketplace stamp (which lives at
  `.metadata.version`, not the `null` top-level `.version`), or skip an
  independently-versioned file. Nothing caught it, because no gate enforced
  consistency and there was no script.
- **The documented safety net was fictional.** Relying on a drift gate that does
  not exist is worse than having none.

## Decision Drivers

### Primary Decision Drivers

1. A version number must reflect an actual change to its component (semantic
   versioning's core promise).
2. A release must be safe to perform and reviewable — small, intentional diffs,
   not an 80-file sweep with no machine check.

### Secondary Decision Drivers

1. Components already version independently in practice (e.g.
   `.claude/skills/readme/SKILL.md` is at `2.0.0`; ontology packs carry their own
   `version` in `ontology.pack.json`), so the lockstep invariant was already
   untrue.
2. Nothing in the distribution *requires* uniform versions — `marketplace.json`
   lists plugins by `source` path and carries no per-plugin version field.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Keep lockstep, add a script and an equality gate

**Description:** Keep stamping every artifact to the release version, but make it
safe with a `bump-version.sh` that rewrites all ~80 stamps and a verify gate that
fails unless every stamp equals `harness.config.json`.

- **Advantages:** One number to reason about ("everything here is 0.4.3"); the
  script + gate remove the corruption risk.
- **Disadvantages:** The diff stays ~80 files per release; version numbers still
  assert changes that did not happen; the equality gate is impossible to satisfy
  without first *down-* or *up-*versioning the already-independent files
  (`readme@2.0.0`, ontology packs), i.e. it fights reality.
- **Risk Assessment:** technical low; schedule low; ecosystem medium (perpetuates
  meaningless version churn).

### Option 2: Change-driven versioning with a pointer, a tool, and a consistency gate

**Description:** A component's version bumps only when its own files change.
`harness.config.json` is the single always-bumps release pointer; the marketplace
catalog tracks it. `scripts/bump-version.sh` moves the pointer, the catalog, and
the CHANGELOG by default, and bumps a pack's three stamps only when that pack is
named with `--pack`. A new `gate_versions` in `verify.sh` enforces the invariants
that actually hold.

- **Advantages:** A release touches only what changed (this release: three files,
  not eighty); version numbers regain meaning; the tool self-verifies and offers a
  `--check` dry run; the gate is satisfiable because it does not assume uniformity.
- **Disadvantages:** Component versions become heterogeneous, so "what version is
  pack X" must be read from pack X, not inferred from the release; `CLAUDE.md` and
  the bump procedure must be rewritten.
- **Risk Assessment:** technical low; schedule low; ecosystem low.

## Decision

Adopt **Option 2: change-driven component versioning.** A component's version
moves only when its files change. `harness.config.json` `.version` is the single
release pointer that always bumps; `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
`.metadata.version` tracks it.

This is realized by:

- **`scripts/bump-version.sh`** — reads the current version from
  `harness.config.json`, resolves the new one (`patch`/`minor`/`major` or an
  explicit semver), and rewrites the template pointer, the marketplace catalog,
  and a new dated `CHANGELOG.md` section. Per-pack stamps move only when a pack is
  passed with `--pack <component>` (then its `plugin.json`, its `SKILL.md`, and its
  `**Version:**` doc row, anchored to the component's section, are bumped). It only
  touches structural JSON fields and section-anchored lines, self-verifies its
  writes, and supports `--check` for a dry run.
- **`gate_versions` in `scripts/verify.sh`** — asserts the template version is
  well-formed semver, the marketplace catalog equals it, and every `SKILL.md` /
  `plugin.json` stamp is well-formed semver (catching a botched bump). It does
  **not** require uniformity, because independent versions (`readme@2.0.0`,
  ontology packs) are legitimate under this model.
- **Completeness proof** — after a bump, `git grep <old-version>` returns only the
  CHANGELOG history line; `git diff --name-only` is the exact, enumerable change
  set. This independent check is what makes any bump — including the first run of a
  new tool on a live release — provably complete.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. A release diff is proportional to the actual change. The `0.4.3` release that
   introduced this model touches three version files, not eighty.
2. Version numbers carry information again: a pack at `0.4.2` in a `0.4.3` harness
   genuinely has not changed since `0.4.2`.
3. The safety net is real and satisfiable: a script that self-verifies plus a gate
   that enforces the true invariants.

### Negative

1. Component versions are heterogeneous; there is no single number that describes
   "everything in this clone." Mitigated by `harness.config.json` remaining the
   one release pointer and the marketplace catalog tracking it.

### Neutral

1. `docs/reference/packs/*.md` version rows are now per-pack and only change when
   that pack changes, so a family doc may show several different versions — correct
   under this model, but different from the old uniform appearance.

## Decision Outcome

The harness now versions by change. The churn and corruption risk of lockstep
stamping are gone, replaced by a single release pointer, a self-verifying tool,
and a consistency gate. The one cost — heterogeneous component versions — is the
honest consequence of letting version numbers mean what they are supposed to mean.

## Audit

### 2026-06-29

**Status:** Compliant

| Finding | Files | Assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single release pointer bumped, catalog tracks it | `harness.config.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | compliant |
| No unchanged pack stamp moved in the 0.4.3 bump | `packs/**`, `.claude/skills/**` | compliant |
| Consistency gate enforces the real invariants | `scripts/verify.sh` | compliant |
| Bump tool self-verifies and supports dry run | `scripts/bump-version.sh` | compliant |

**Summary:** The 0.4.3 release was performed change-driven and verified by `git grep` completeness and `gate_versions`.

**Action Required:** None
