# Architectural Decision Records

This directory records the architectural decisions behind the research-harness
template, using the [Structured MADR (SMADR)](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/structured-madr)
format — MADR enriched with structured YAML frontmatter, per-option risk
assessment, and an audit trail. Each record captures one decision: its context,
the options weighed, the outcome, the consequences, and an audit of how the
decision is realized in the repository. Records are immutable once accepted; a
reversal is a new record that supersedes the old one.

Start a new record from [`template.md`](template.md), numbered sequentially.
