# Reference: documentation coverage

This page is the audit index for the harness's adoptable surface. Every pack,
core skill, command, agent, and script discoverable in the repository appears
below with a link to where it is documented. The counts at the end assert that
the **discovered** set equals the **documented** set.

## Coverage summary

| Category | Discovered | Documented | Source of truth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Packs | 29 | 29 | `harness.config.json` `packs[]` (17) + `packs/ontologies/` (12) |
| Core skills | 10 | 10 | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| Commands | 7 | 7 | `.claude/commands/*.md` |
| Agents | 5 | 5 | `.claude/agents/*.md` |
| Scripts | 29 | 29 | `scripts/**` (excludes `__pycache__`) |
| **Total** | **80** | **80** | — |

Reproduce the discovered counts:

```sh
# packs: 17 plugin packs + 12 ontology packs = 29
echo $(( $(jq '.packs | length' harness.config.json) + $(ls -d packs/ontologies/*/ | wc -l) ))
ls .claude/skills | wc -l        # 10 core skills
ls .claude/commands/*.md | wc -l # 7 commands
ls .claude/agents/*.md | wc -l   # 5 agents
find scripts -type f \( -name '*.sh' -o -name '*.py' -o -name '*.jq' \) \
  | grep -v __pycache__ | wc -l  # 29 scripts
```
