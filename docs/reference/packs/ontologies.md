# Ontology packs

Ontology packs extend the MIF entity vocabulary for a specific domain. Each pack
supplies a `*.ontology.yaml` that declares namespaces, entity types, relationships,
and discovery patterns. Binding an ontology pack lets the research engine recognize,
classify, and relate domain entities found in sources.

Ontology packs have no external dependencies and no SKILL.md — they are data packs,
not skill packs.

For control-plane mechanics see [Packs and Plugins](../packs-and-plugins.md).

## Enabling and binding an ontology

Ontology packs use a **different control surface** from the skill/channel/genre
plugin packs. They are declared in `harness.config.json` `ontologies[]` (an `id`
plus an `enabled` flag), not in `packs[]`, so `scripts/pack-toggle.sh` does not
apply to them. Enabling an ontology is two steps:

1. Set its `enabled` flag to `true` in `ontologies[]` (the per-pack "Enable"
   command below does exactly this for that pack's `id`).
2. Bind the enabled ontology to a research topic with the `/ontology-review`
   command, whose deterministic engine is `scripts/ontology-review.sh`. Binding
   is what lets findings in that topic resolve to the ontology's entity types;
   per-finding classification is handled by `scripts/resolve-ontology.sh`.

`resolve-ontology.sh` requires `yq`, `jq`, and `ajv` (see
[dependencies](../dependencies.md)).
