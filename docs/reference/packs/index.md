# Packs Reference

Packs extend the research harness with domain knowledge, output channels, and data vocabularies.
Each pack is a self-contained unit: one plugin per skill, with its own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `SKILL.md`.
Ontology packs use `*.ontology.yaml` and `ontology.pack.json` instead of a skill.

For control-plane mechanics — enabling, disabling, and listing packs — see
[Packs and Plugins](../packs-and-plugins.md).
