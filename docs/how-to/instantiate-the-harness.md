# How to instantiate the harness

The harness is distributed as a **living, update-propagating template** (design
spec §7). There are three ways to stand up your own instance from
`research-harness-template`; they differ in one decisive way — whether you can
later pull template improvements with `copier update`.

| Path | Gets the files | `copier update` works after? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `copier copy` (recommended) | yes | **yes** — records `.copier-answers.yml` |
| GitHub "Use this template" | yes | no (until you adopt copier — see below) |
| `git clone` | yes | no |

## Option A — Copier (recommended: living template)

`copier copy` renders the template, asks the instantiation questions, and writes
a `.copier-answers.yml` that records the template version and your answers. That
answers file is what makes the instance *updatable* — **commit it** (it is not
gitignored): `copier update` reads its `_commit` as the merge base, so an
uncommitted or lost answers file breaks future updates.

```bash
pipx install copier            # or: pipx install copier && pipx ensurepath
copier copy gh:zircote/research-harness-template my-harness
cd my-harness
```

Copier strips template-only files at generation (`copier.yml`'s `_exclude`:
`copier.yml`, `COMPLETION-CRITERIA.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`, `PROGRESS.md`,
the template's CI). Only `*.jinja` files are rendered (suffix dropped); every
other file is copied verbatim, so the contracts, scripts, agents, and gates
travel unchanged.

### Pull later template improvements

This is the differentiator over snapshot engines. When the template ships a fix
or addition (for example the sigint→MIF converter), re-apply it to your instance:

```bash
cd my-harness
copier update            # re-applies template changes, preserving your answers
```

`copier update` uses the recorded `.copier-answers.yml` to merge template
changes into your instance without clobbering your edits (it conflict-marks the
one file you hand-edit, `harness.config.json`).

## Option B — GitHub "Create repo from template"

GitHub's **Use this template → Create a new repository** copies the template
contents into a fresh repo you own. This is the quickest start and gives you a
clean git history, but the copy is a **snapshot**: there is no
`.copier-answers.yml`, so `copier update` cannot run and later template
improvements will not propagate automatically.

After creating from template:

1. Remove the template-only scaffolding that GitHub's copy carries over (these
   are excluded by `copier copy` but not by GitHub's template feature):

   ```bash
   git rm copier.yml COMPLETION-CRITERIA.md IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md PROGRESS.md
   git rm .copier-answers.yml.jinja docs/harness-instance.md.jinja
   ```

2. Edit `harness.config.json` to declare your topics, dimensions, outputs, and
   packs.
3. Run `bash scripts/verify.sh` — it must exit `0`.

### Adopt copier later (to regain update propagation)

If you started from a GitHub template copy (or a plain clone) and want update
propagation, adopt copier retroactively:

```bash
copier copy --answers-file .copier-answers.yml \
  gh:zircote/research-harness-template .
```

This writes the `.copier-answers.yml` your instance was missing; subsequent
`copier update` runs then propagate template changes.

## Option C — Plain git clone

`git clone` gives you the template files verbatim, including the template-only
scaffolding and with no `.copier-answers.yml`. Treat it like Option B: strip the
template-only files and, if you want update propagation, adopt copier as above.
