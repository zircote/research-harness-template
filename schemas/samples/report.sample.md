This is the canonical MIF Level-3 markdown report sample: authoritative YAML
frontmatter (the MIF concept) over a clean Markdown body. The title lives in the
frontmatter, so the body carries no top-level heading. The frontmatter projects to
a JSON-LD finding that validates against `schemas/findings.schema.json`, and the
body becomes the MIF `content`.
