# Changelog

All notable changes to the research-harness template are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- The 17 remaining bundled report-genre packs are retired in favor of
  external consumption from `mif-docs-plugin`, completing the
  genre-consolidation migration piloted by `engineering`
  (research-harness-template#228): `academic`, `briefing`, `computing-paper`,
  `humanities-mla`, `humanities-chicago`, `clinical-submission`, `nist-sp`,
  `regulatory-disclosure`, `compliance-audit`, `security-pentest`,
  `legal-memo`, `market-research-report`, `sustainability-report`,
  `trend-analysis`, `competitive-quadrant`, `systematic-review`,
  `exec-summary`. There
  is no longer a `packs/reports/` directory — all 18 report genres now
  resolve via `harness.config.json` `packs[].source` `marketplace-ref`
  entries against the shared `mif-docs` marketplace declaration. Genre
  capability is unchanged; each genre's MIF frontmatter authoring and
  conformance now go through `mif-docs`' shared substrate.
- `scripts/check-pack-docs.py`'s external-pack resolution now tracks which
  family each external name actually resolved into, fixing a name-collision
  bug where a report genre and an unrelated ontology sharing the same name
  (`trend-analysis`) could cross-contaminate each other's outbound-link and
  README-exemption checks.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **`harness.config.json` `marketplaces[]`** — declare an external Claude Code
  plugin source once (`name`, `url`, a pinned `ref`); any number of `packs[]`
  entries reference it via `source: {type: "marketplace-ref", marketplace:
  <name>}` instead of each repeating an identical `{type, url, ref}` object. A
  pack's own `ref` overrides the marketplace's for that pack only.
  `scripts/sync-packs.sh` and `scripts/check-pack-docs.py` resolve it; a new
  `verify.sh` gate (5d2) proves the sharing and the per-pack override.
- The `engineering` pack's source is migrated from an inline external object
  to a `mif-docs` marketplace reference, ahead of migrating the harness's
  remaining report genres onto it.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- The `engineering` report genre is now consumed externally from
  [`mif-docs-plugin`](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/mif-docs-plugin)
  (SHA-pinned via `harness.config.json` `packs[]`) instead of the bundled
  `packs/reports/engineering` pack, which is retired. This is the pilot genre
  for the genre-consolidation migration onto `mif-docs` as the single genre
  and conformance authority
  (research-harness-template#228). The genre's capability, including the
  optional Mermaid architecture-diagram figure, is unchanged; its MIF
  frontmatter authoring and conformance now go through `mif-docs`' shared
  `mif-frontmatter` / `mif-validate` substrate.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- Re-cut of 0.8.0 (the v0.8.0 tag was bound to a deleted release); no functional changes. See 0.8.0 notes below.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- **Domain ontology packs are now vendored on demand, not bundled** (#224,
  completing ADR-0012). The 12 domain packs under `packs/ontologies/*` are
  `git rm`'d and the directory is gitignored; only base layers under
  `schemas/ontologies/` ship committed. Clones/CI vendor the enabled packs from
  the canonical registry (`scripts/fetch-ontology.sh --all-enabled`,
  sha256-verified, pinned in `ontologies.lock.json`) before the catalog is built
  — wired into copier `_tasks` and the CI `verify` job ahead of `verify.sh`. The
  `ontologies.lock.json` pin ships committed and `check-ontology-lock.sh` proves
  no drift (#222 follow-through: lock present + gate-clean). `gate_m22` vendors
  its `software-security` subtype_of exemplar on demand. Override the registry
  source for dev/CI/offline with `$MIF_ONTOLOGY_SOURCE`.

### Added

- **README "not a chatbot deep-research" notice** — clarifies the harness is a
  falsified deep-exploration + knowledge-graph engine (adversarial falsification,
  depth, reusable accreting results), and that AI *will* make mistakes, which is
  why the schema/ontology/MIF/falsification rigor exists.

### Fixed

- `evals/copier-update.sh` now treats copier's post-apply temp-clone cleanup
  race (Python 3.14 `rmtree` "Directory not empty" on `copier._main.new_copy*`)
  as success — the render already landed; the script's assertions verify it — and
  still retries the pre-apply local-clone hardlink race.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **Ship the cross-topic concordance** `reports/concordance.json` (#218). The
  ontological spine is now rebuilt over the shipped example corpus
  (`scripts/build-concordance.sh`: 36 nodes / 46 edges) and committed, reflecting the
  domain-pack entity types the corpus resolves to (`trend`, `segment`,
  `sizing-estimate`, `value-proposition`, `market-intelligence-report`,
  `critical-uncertainty`, `emerging-issue`, `data-provenance`, …). `verify.sh`'s
  template corpus-shape gate (8c) now allows this deterministic, allowlisted artifact
  alongside `_meta/` and the archived example topic.

### Removed

- **Retired the seed-time `schemas/mif/VENDOR.lock` provenance file** (#223). It is
  moot under on-demand vendoring (ADR-0012, #221): the registry-pinned
  `ontologies.lock.json` + `scripts/check-ontology-lock.sh` now carry vendored-pack
  provenance, and the MIF contract is first-class and editable in-repo. `gate_m12`
  drops its verbatim-set assertion (subsection 12d); it still validates the contract
  and every registry ontology, asserts `id@version` uniqueness, and exercises the
  resolver/pack-enable matrix. Docs reconciled (ADR-0002 audit, ontology-conformance,
  contracts reference, COMPLETION-CRITERIA, `ontology-manager` skill).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **On-demand ontology vendoring** (ADR-0012). Domain ontologies are fetched from
  the canonical registry (the `ontologies` repo → `mif-spec.dev/ontologies/`) and
  verified fail-closed against a pinned `sha256` index, instead of every clone
  bundling every ontology. New `scripts/fetch-ontology.sh` (resolve the `extends`
  closure, fetch, sha256-verify, materialize `packs/ontologies/<id>/`, pin
  `ontologies.lock.json`); `scripts/check-ontology-lock.sh` (drift gate — a
  vendored copy must match its pinned hash, so fixes go upstream, not in place);
  and `scripts/author-ontology.sh` (when no ontology covers a domain, scaffold one
  from the topic's observed entity types and concierge a draft PR upstream). Base
  layers stay committed. Covered by `evals/ontology-vendoring.sh`. Flipping the
  bundled domain packs to a gitignored on-demand cache (with corpus re-enrichment)
  is a staged follow-up once the registry is served.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- **Project hooks skip cleanly when their script is absent.** Each `.claude/settings.json`
  PreToolUse, PostToolUse, and Stop hook command now guards on the script's presence
  (`[ -f "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/…" ] || exit 0`) before invoking it, so a
  partial checkout or any context without the harness hook scripts no-ops the hook
  instead of failing the tool call.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **`ai-spec` channel + spec-genre packs.** A new `ai-spec` channel pack renders a
  topic's surviving findings into an AI-ready, agent-executable architecture spec — a
  genre-shaping of the `artifact.json` → Markdown pipeline (`finding_refs[]` → grounded
  evidence sections, the goal's `completion_condition.checks[]` → EARS acceptance
  criteria, `artifact.sections[]` → structure). It pairs with a new `packs/genres/`
  family carrying one pack per spec genre: `architecture-spec` (arc42/C4 §1–§12 +
  EARS), `kiro-spec` (requirements → design → tasks), and `feature-spec` (Spec Kit
  single capability). All optional and toggle-ready (`enabled:false`), registered in
  `harness.config.json` and the marketplace.
- **Cognitive-triad explanation** (`docs/explanation/cognitive-triad.md`). Codifies why
  an entity type's `base` is the closed set `_semantic`/`_procedural`/`_episodic`
  (Tulving's memory systems, cited as MIF `Citation` objects), the base-vs-namespace
  distinction, and why a derivation method such as "analytical" is never a base — its
  outputs (`forecast`/`scenario`/`adoption-curve`) are `_semantic`.
- **Worked specimens.** One worked example per genre in the bundled
  `example-okf-mif-knowledge-spine` topic (`*-build-spec.md`), each a MIF Level-1
  deliverable grounded in surviving findings with EARS criteria drawn from the goal checks.

### Changed

- **Five domain ontology packs conformed to the build-spec.** `software-security`,
  `regulatory-legal`, `scientific`, `market-research`, and `trend-analysis` now carry
  prior-art grounding (`source_vocab`/`source_class`/`prior_art`/`disposition`) on every
  entity type and provenance traits resolved from `shared-traits` (seven generic
  provenance traits promoted there). All shipped types preserved; `regulatory-legal`
  gains the missing `compliance-regulation`; `analytical`-rooted types conformed to
  `_semantic`. Packs validate and resolve fail-closed through the catalog.
- The output-conformance hook exempts `*-build-spec.md` (the `ai-spec` channel's
  Level-1 agent-consumable spec) from the Level-3 write-time check.

### Fixed

- `build-topic-readme.sh`: list `*-build-spec.md` deliverables in the topic README
  Reports table (only `*-delta.md` build logs stay excluded), and force `LC_ALL=C`
  on the Reports-table sort so the generated README is byte-identical across build
  hosts (a locale-sensitive `sort -k2` made the README-freshness gate flap between
  macOS and the Linux CI runner).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Fail-closed ontology-completeness gate + auto-reconciled spine** (Epic 1). The
  research loop now reconciles the cross-topic concordance as a first-class
  pre-synthesis stage. `scripts/check-shippable-typing.sh` blocks synthesis until
  every shippable (`survived`/`weakened`) finding resolves to a valid ontology type,
  and the orchestrator builds + validates `reports/concordance.json` before spawning
  the report-synthesizer. Falsified, quarantined, and inconclusive findings never
  block; `/ontology-review --enrich` then `/resume` is the unblock path. New
  ADR-0011 records the decision and `gate_m24` enforces it.
- **Ontology-aware synthesis** (Epic 2). `scripts/synthesize-artifact.sh` joins each
  report section to its finding's resolved type (`entityType`/`ontology`/`basis`)
  from `ontology-map.json`, and the `report` channel renders the resolved type in
  its provenance line. The no-map path stays byte-identical, so existing renders are
  unaffected.
- **Cross-topic corpus atlas** (Epic 2). New `scripts/synthesize-corpus.sh`,
  `corpus-synthesizer` agent, and `/synthesize-corpus` command project the spine
  (`reports/concordance.json`) into `reports/_corpus/corpus-synthesis.md` — the whole
  research record across every topic, **including what was falsified or weakened**
  (which the survivors-only report-synthesizer omits). `gate_m25` covers it.
- **Concordance scale-query verbs** in the `graph` skill: `--reuse`,
  `--contradictions`, and `--disproven` over `reports/concordance.json` (graph skill
  bumped to `0.5.0`).
- **Org governance reference** (`docs/reference/org-governance.md`) cross-linking the
  org release, branch-protection, Dependabot auto-merge, and labels runbooks plus the
  reusable-workflow CI architecture, reachable from `SECURITY.md` and `README.md`.

### Fixed

- `copier update` now re-runs `sync-packs.sh` (added to copier `_tasks`), so the
  derived ontology catalog (`.claude/enabled-packs.json`) never goes stale after an
  update — a stale catalog missing an `extends` target would otherwise make the
  fail-closed resolver mark the whole bound corpus invalid.
- `evals/copier-update.sh` now surfaces copier's stderr instead of swallowing it and
  retries the transient local-clone hardlink race, so a genuine failure is
  diagnosable rather than an undiagnosable "flake."

## [0.4.3] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- A MIF-branded **social-preview card** (`.github/social-preview.svg` / `.png`)
  and a README hero banner. The card frames the harness as a MIF-native engine
  across three pillars — MIF substrate, ontological spine, and a living knowledge
  graph that grows each session — the last shown as a typed cyan spine accreting
  amber findings.
- `scripts/bump-version.sh` — a change-driven version-bump tool. It moves the
  template release pointer (`harness.config.json`), the marketplace catalog
  (`.metadata.version`), and inserts the CHANGELOG section, and bumps a pack's
  stamps (`plugin.json`, its `SKILL.md`, and its family-doc row) only when that
  pack is named with `--pack`. It self-verifies and supports `--check` (dry run).
- A **version-consistency gate** in `scripts/verify.sh`: the marketplace catalog
  version equals the template version, and every skill/plugin stamp is well-formed
  semver. It does not force uniformity (independent versions stay legal), replacing
  the previously-claimed (but unenforced) lockstep gate.
- A **bump-on-change CI gate** (`scripts/check-version-bump.sh`, wired as the
  PR-only `version-bump` job): a changed pack or core skill must move its own
  version, and any change must move the `harness.config.json` release pointer, or
  CI fails naming the un-bumped component. `[skip-version-check]` on its own line
  in a commit waives the pointer rule for a change that warrants no release.

### Changed

- **Versioning is now change-driven, not lockstep** (ADR-0010). A pack or skill
  version bumps only when its own files change; `harness.config.json` is the sole
  always-bumps release pointer. A release that touches no pack now changes three
  files instead of ~80, removing the per-release stamp churn and the corruption
  risk it carried. `CLAUDE.md` is updated to document the new model and tool.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- The bundled **archived example research corpus** (`reports/example-okf-mif-knowledge-spine`)
  ships to every clone as its inherited seed fixture — keeping the same name in the template
  and in clones — so a fresh clone shows the engine's worked output immediately. The
  `copier-update` eval asserts it ships archived on copy and survives `copier update` without
  duplication or conflict. (It is served straight out of `reports/`; the prior `example-`-prefix
  rename was dropped — renaming the corpus directory inside copier's update render destabilized
  copier's temp-dir cleanup.)

### Changed

- The bundled example is now a single **archived** research topic served straight out of
  `reports/` — `example-okf-mif-knowledge-spine`, a worked OKF + MIF knowledge-spine corpus
  (36 findings, knowledge graph, falsification report, and a full set of genre reports:
  exec-summary, briefing, market-research-report, market-sizing, competitive-analysis,
  competitive-quadrant, trend-analysis, trend-modeling, academic, engineering, and
  computing-paper). The distribution gate (`verify.sh` 8c) now permits this one served
  example under `reports/` alongside `reports/_meta/`.
- **The site now serves the full topic deliverable tree** — the README (as the topic
  index at `/reports/<topic>/`), the neutral synthesis, the falsification report, the
  research-progress log, and every genre report all render, instead of being excluded
  (these are critical consumer-facing deliverables). `src/content.config.ts` wraps `glob()`
  to DERIVE the Starlight `title` from each file's body `# H1` (so the generated artifacts
  are never mutated and clones get the same behaviour) and re-slugs the README to the topic
  index; a `remarkStripReportH1` plugin drops the duplicate body heading at render. The
  reports **sidebar lists one link per topic** (its README index), not a per-report tree, and
  a `Sidebar` component override adds a client-side **topic filter**. ADR-0009 is amended to
  record this (superseding its README/falsification exclusions).
- The **readme channel** is upgraded toward the `zircote/research` per-topic exemplars:
  a falsification audit-trail line in the header, dimensions rendered with their
  descriptions, a richer Artifacts table (type + size), backtick-quoted tags, an optional
  hero image, and a **Reports table listing the topic's constituents as Type → Title** in a
  deterministic reader-consumption order (executive summary → briefing → synthesis → genre
  reports → falsification report → research progress).
- Site sidebar groups collapse by default so a large corpus stays navigable.

### Removed

- The legacy `example-topic` placeholder and the `topic_id` / `topic_title` copier
  prompts. The inherited archived seed is the clone's starting topic; run `/start` to
  research new topics.

### Fixed

- The rendered site now builds and navigates the full instance corpus, not just
  the example. `harness-instance.md.jinja` ships Starlight frontmatter (it was
  frontmatter-less and aborted `astro build`/`dev` in every clone); Copier
  re-establishes the `docs/reports` and `src/content/docs` symlinks it flattens
  on render, and `gate_m23` now asserts both; and the content glob excludes
  audit/continuity artifacts (`*-falsification-report.md`, `*-delta.md`,
  `*-build-spec.md`) that carry no Starlight frontmatter. (#164, #165)
- `scripts/render-artifact.sh` derived the report intro's "covers N surviving finding(s)"
  from the section count, which undercounts once a genre reshapes sections; it now counts
  `finding_refs` (the true surviving-finding total), accurate for every genre.
- Findings now carry a top-level `namespace` field. The example corpus's 36 findings
  omitted it (it lived only inside the `@id` URN), so `build-index.sh` projected
  `namespace: null` for every finding and namespace-scoped `/search` + the `/topics`
  rollup silently broke (and report synthesis fell back to a `harness/report` namespace).
  The corpus is backfilled, the `dimension-analyst` now emits the field, and a new
  fail-closed gate (`verify.sh` 8e) requires every finding under `reports/**/findings`
  to carry a non-empty top-level `namespace` so the omission can never ship silently.
  The `topics` and `discover` skill evals are realigned to the new manifest (sole
  archived example topic; four research dimensions).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- The Reports surface now has a stable `/reports/` index page
  (`src/pages/reports.astro`) that lists this harness's report topics from the docs
  collection: empty-safe before the first report, the example topic in the template,
  a clone's own reports in an instance. The splash landing gains a "Read the reports"
  hero action and a Reports card, and the Reports sidebar group gains an "Overview"
  link, all pointing at it.
- Auto-redeploy: `docs.yml` fires the `source-updated` `repository_dispatch` the org
  Pages `deploy.yml` listens for after a green build on a push to `main`
  (authenticating as the org GitHub App, scoped to the org Pages repo), so a merge
  republishes the live site automatically. Previously the live site only updated on a
  manual deploy dispatch. `gate_m23` gains 23e (landing surfaced) and 23f (dispatch
  wired; template-only).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- The Astro/Starlight site now renders `reports/` as a first-class surface for
  human reading: each `reports/<topic>/<slug>.md` becomes a page in a **Reports**
  sidebar group (mermaid + relative links resolved), covered by `llms.txt`. The
  template hosts a rendered **example-topic** report so the docs site demonstrates
  the reports surface; a clone is activated reports-primary at instantiation.
- `harness.config.json` gains an optional `site` block (validated by the schema):
  `primarySurface` (`reports|docs|auto`) and `plugins` gates for `llmsTxt`,
  `mermaid`, `imageZoom`, `linksValidator`. `astro.config.mjs` reads it at build
  time, so neither the template nor a clone hand-edits `astro.config.mjs`.
- `scripts/site-toggle.sh` — flip the site surface or an optional plugin from the
  manifest. Two optional Starlight plugins are bundled (default off):
  `starlight-image-zoom` and `starlight-links-validator`.
- `/configure` command + `harness-configurator` agent — a configuration concierge
  that toggles packs and site features, manages ontologies and topics, and re-runs
  the gates.
- Copier post-copy `_tasks` hook (with `_message_after_copy`) activates a clone's
  reports surface on `copier copy --trust`; the bundled example report is excluded
  from clones so `copier update` stays conflict-free.
- `gate_m23` (site projection) and the `site-toggle` eval.

### Changed

- Upgraded the docs site to **Astro 7 / Starlight 0.41** (from Astro 6 / Starlight
  0.40), mirroring the sibling MIF repo. `astro-rehype-relative-markdown-links` is
  retained via a `package.json` `overrides` peer relaxation (it still resolves the
  docs' relative `.md` links on Astro 7); the `gray-matter` patch is retained (the
  relative-links plugin reads link targets through `gray-matter`, which calls the
  `safeLoad` removed in js-yaml 4). The Astro-6-pinned `esbuild` override is dropped.

### Fixed

- `scripts/update.sh` now handles cross-platform reproducibility misses
  (macOS/BSD vs Linux `git archive | gzip -n` bytes) with a sanctioned fail-closed
  fallback: verify the downloaded release asset's attestation, then require
  extracted-content equality with the pinned commit SHA before applying
  `copier update --vcs-ref <sha>` (issue #151).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- MIT `LICENSE` at the repo root (the template is now explicitly MIT-licensed).

### Security

- Remediated GHSA-h67p-54hq-rp68 / CVE-2026-53550 (quadratic-complexity DoS in
  `js-yaml` YAML merge-key handling). `js-yaml` is forced to `>= 4.2.0` via an npm
  `overrides` entry, and `gray-matter` — which hard-pins the unmaintained 3.x line
  and pulled it transitively into the docs build — is patched with `patch-package`
  (`yaml.safeLoad`/`safeDump` → `yaml.load`/`dump`, a faithful rename since those
  are 4.x's safe variants). No upstream fix exists, so the committed lockfile is
  pinned forward to keep instantiated harnesses clean.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Fail-closed provenance gate before `copier update` (issue #94). `scripts/update.sh`
  is the only supported update path: it resolves the target release tag, pins it to a
  commit SHA, reproduces the release artifact, and verifies its SLSA build-provenance
  attestation with the same primitive as `release.yml`/CI/`SECURITY.md`
  (`gh attestation verify --repo … --signer-workflow …/release.yml`). Any miss exits
  non-zero and never invokes Copier; on success it runs `copier update --vcs-ref
  <verified-sha>` (TOCTOU-closed). The trust root is the signer-workflow identity baked
  into the wrapper, established once at clone and verify-before-apply protected.
  `evals/update-provenance.sh` (run in CI via `run-evals.sh`) asserts the gate fails
  closed; docs: a how-to ("update your harness safely") and an explanation
  ("update-channel provenance model").
- A layered ontology spine. New MIF-compliant intermediate layer
  `engineering-base` (`schemas/ontologies/engineering-base/0.1.0.yaml`, cataloged
  `core=false`) declares the engineering supertypes shared across domains —
  `component`, `architectural-decision`, `design-pattern`, `delivery-metric`,
  `engineering-practice`, `process-discipline` — plus `depends_on`/`implements`.
  The engineering domain packs `extends: engineering-base`, so resolution is
  transitive: binding a domain pack resolves the supertypes its ancestor layers
  declare. The layer is present-but-not-core, so non-engineering topics never
  resolve these types — keeping the upstream-submittable generic core
  domain-neutral. `gate_m21` proves the positive (descendant resolves an
  ancestor-layer type) and the negative (a non-engineering topic does not).
- Cross-cutting universals in `engineering-base` — `control`, `artifact`,
  `policy`, `provenance` — with edges `governs` (control/policy →
  component/artifact), `attests` (provenance → artifact), and `derived_from`
  (artifact lineage). `data-engineering` adds `governed_by` (data-product/storage
  → control/policy), realizing the data/security governance cross-cut.
- Entity-type subsumption: a new first-class `subtype_of` field on entity types
  (declared in `ontology.schema.json`). A subtype is substitutable for its
  supertype at a relationship endpoint, enforced by `validate-concordance.sh` and
  `gate_m22`. `software-security.security-control` is `subtype_of: [control]`, so it
  satisfies the cross-cutting `governs` edge; a non-subtype is rejected.
- A root `CLAUDE.md` orienting Claude Code to the harness (gates, contracts, the
  goal-driven engine, pack control plane, and the conventions that bite). It is
  template-managed and re-applied on update; the new
  `docs/how-to/instantiate-the-harness.md` section recommends instance owners put
  their own clone-specific guidance in a `CLAUDE.local.md` (loaded automatically,
  never touched by `copier update`).

### Changed

- `resolve-ontology.sh` and `validate-concordance.sh` now walk the `extends`
  chain when building a topic's allowed ontology set (fail-closed if an
  `extends` target is not cataloged). `sync-packs.sh` catalogs non-core layers
  under `schemas/ontologies/` as `core=false` (only `mif-base`, `mif-generic`,
  `shared-traits` are core).
- Renamed the `security` ontology pack to `software-security` (extends
  `engineering-base`); moved the SDLC-facing `security-threat`,
  `security-framework`, and `security-incident` supertypes into it from
  `software-engineering`, where the finer STIX/ATT&CK/CWE types refine them.
  Renamed its `control` type to `security-control` (the security specialization of
  the new generic `engineering-base` `control`).
- Deduplicated the engineering domain packs: `software-engineering` (0.5.0) now
  carries only SDLC-operational types (`incident-report`, `runbook`,
  `deployment-procedure`, `migration-guide`); `data-engineering` (0.2.0) carries
  only data-specific types. Both inherit the shared supertypes and the generic
  `technology` (which is a MIF built-in in `mif-generic`) instead of copying them.
- Nothing is vendor-locked. `VENDOR.lock` no longer marks any file `verbatim:true`
  (the MIF contract `ontology.schema.json` + context are unlocked); `gate_m12` now
  asserts the verbatim set is empty. `VENDOR.lock` is retained for provenance
  (source/commit + seed checksums). The contract is first-class and evolves in-repo
  on its way back to MIF — conformance stays fail-closed by validation, not by
  freezing files.
- The graph visualization is now a real interactive force-directed node-link
  diagram (issue #91). `build-graph-viz.sh` replaces the two `<ul>` lists with a
  deterministic SVG layout (seeded circle + fixed-iteration Fruchterman-Reingold,
  no RNG), concept/entity nodes colored and sized by degree, typed edges
  (`supports`/`contradicts`/`derived-from`/`mentions`) with distinct color, dash,
  and arrowheads, edge-type labels, hover tooltips, a legend, and draggable nodes
  — still self-contained vanilla SVG + JS (no CDN, no network). The embedded graph
  JSON escapes `</` so a label containing `</script>` cannot break out of the tag.
- Ephemeral viz HTML no longer dirties the working tree (issue #91).
  `build-graph-viz.sh` defaults its output to a `mktemp` path **outside** the
  project tree (an explicit second argument still writes in-repo); the `verify.sh`
  M-graph gate renders its probe into a temp dir and removes it. Only tracked data
  artifacts (findings, `knowledge-graph.json`, `concordance.json`, maps) belong in
  `reports/` — documented in `docs/reference/scripts.md`.

### Removed

- `compliance-regulation` (modeled in `regulatory-legal` as `legal-act`/
  `obligation`) and the deprecated `adoption-trend` (superseded by
  `trend-analysis`'s `trend`) are dropped from the engineering packs. Pre-stable
  clean break — no back-compat aliases.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- `SECURITY.md` with a "Verifying Release Artifacts" section documenting the
  strict `gh attestation verify` command (pinned to the release workflow via
  `--signer-workflow`) and how to report vulnerabilities.

### Changed

- The release workflow re-verifies the SLSA build-provenance attestation
  before publishing (fail-closed) and pins trust to the release workflow with
  `--signer-workflow`, so a tag never publishes an unverified artifact and an
  attestation from any other workflow in the repository is rejected.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-23

First release of the domain-general research harness template.

### Added

- **Four-layer architecture** in one repository — engine (`.claude/agents` and
  `.claude/commands`), contracts (`schemas/`), harness services (topic registry,
  knowledge graph, search, discovery), and outputs (`reports/`, channels, packs)
  — all shipping on clone. See
  [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-four-layer-single-repository-architecture.md).
- **MIF Level-3 I/O conformance**: findings are individual MIF memory units
  validated against the vendored `schemas/mif/` closure.
- **Goal-driven sessions**: a content-hashed, append-only goal
  (`schemas/goal.schema.json`) initiates, steers, and gates each run.
- **Config-declared dimensions** read from `harness.config.json` (`technical`,
  `landscape`, `trajectory`) — not a fixed taxonomy.
- **Single adversarial falsification gate** assigning ordinal verdicts
  (`falsified` / `weakened` / `survived` / `inconclusive`) with one-round
  remediation.
- **Packs and plugins**: one plugin per skill, toggled via the
  `harness.config.json` `packs[]` control plane and the
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` marketplace. Channel packs (book, Diátaxis,
  PDF, NotebookLM, GitHub Discussions, GitHub Issues), report genres,
  methodologies, and ontologies.
- **Output channels**: blog (first-class, always on) and the canonical MIF
  Level-3 report channel as the source of truth.
- **Diátaxis documentation set** under `docs/` (tutorials, how-to, reference,
  explanation) plus Architectural Decision Records under `docs/adr/`.
- **Attested delivery**: SHA-pinned GitHub Actions enforced by a `pin-check`
  CI gate, and a release workflow that attests a reproducible source tarball
  with SLSA build provenance via `actions/attest-build-provenance`.
- **Distribution** as a Copier living template and a Claude Code plugin
  marketplace.
