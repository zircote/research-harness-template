and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A layered ontology spine. New MIF-compliant intermediate layer
  `engineering-base` (`schemas/ontologies/engineering-base/0.1.0.yaml`, cataloged
  `core=false`) declares the engineering supertypes shared across domains —
  `component`, `architectural-decision`, `design-pattern`, `delivery-metric`,
  `engineering-practice`, `process-discipline` — plus `depends_on`/`implements`.
  The engineering domain packs `extends: engineering-base`, so resolution is
  transitive: binding a domain pack resolves the supertypes its ancestor layers
  declare. The layer is present-but-not-core, so non-engineering topics never
  resolve these types — keeping the upstream-submittable generic core
  domain-neutral. `gate_m21` proves the positive (descendant resolves an
  ancestor-layer type) and the negative (a non-engineering topic does not).
- Cross-cutting universals in `engineering-base` — `control`, `artifact`,
  `policy`, `provenance` — with edges `governs` (control/policy →
  component/artifact), `attests` (provenance → artifact), and `derived_from`
  (artifact lineage). `data-engineering` adds `governed_by` (data-product/storage
  → control/policy), realizing the data/security governance cross-cut.
- Entity-type subsumption: a new first-class `subtype_of` field on entity types
  (declared in `ontology.schema.json`). A subtype is substitutable for its
  supertype at a relationship endpoint, enforced by `validate-concordance.sh` and
  `gate_m22`. `software-security.security-control` is `subtype_of: [control]`, so it
  satisfies the cross-cutting `governs` edge; a non-subtype is rejected.

### Changed

- `resolve-ontology.sh` and `validate-concordance.sh` now walk the `extends`
  chain when building a topic's allowed ontology set (fail-closed if an
  `extends` target is not cataloged). `sync-packs.sh` catalogs non-core layers
  under `schemas/ontologies/` as `core=false` (only `mif-base`, `mif-generic`,
  `shared-traits` are core).
- Renamed the `security` ontology pack to `software-security` (extends
  `engineering-base`); moved the SDLC-facing `security-threat`,
  `security-framework`, and `security-incident` supertypes into it from
  `software-engineering`, where the finer STIX/ATT&CK/CWE types refine them.
  Renamed its `control` type to `security-control` (the security specialization of
  the new generic `engineering-base` `control`).
- Deduplicated the engineering domain packs: `software-engineering` (0.5.0) now
  carries only SDLC-operational types (`incident-report`, `runbook`,
  `deployment-procedure`, `migration-guide`); `data-engineering` (0.2.0) carries
  only data-specific types. Both inherit the shared supertypes and the generic
  `technology` (which is a MIF built-in in `mif-generic`) instead of copying them.
- Nothing is vendor-locked. `VENDOR.lock` no longer marks any file `verbatim:true`
  (the MIF contract `ontology.schema.json` + context are unlocked); `gate_m12` now
  asserts the verbatim set is empty. `VENDOR.lock` is retained for provenance
  (source/commit + seed checksums). The contract is first-class and evolves in-repo
  on its way back to MIF — conformance stays fail-closed by validation, not by
  freezing files.

### Removed

- `compliance-regulation` (modeled in `regulatory-legal` as `legal-act`/
  `obligation`) and the deprecated `adoption-trend` (superseded by
  `trend-analysis`'s `trend`) are dropped from the engineering packs. Pre-stable
  clean break — no back-compat aliases.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- `SECURITY.md` with a "Verifying Release Artifacts" section documenting the
  strict `gh attestation verify` command (pinned to the release workflow via
  `--signer-workflow`) and how to report vulnerabilities.

### Changed

- The release workflow re-verifies the SLSA build-provenance attestation
  before publishing (fail-closed) and pins trust to the release workflow with
  `--signer-workflow`, so a tag never publishes an unverified artifact and an
  attestation from any other workflow in the repository is rejected.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-23

First release of the domain-general research harness template.

### Added

- **Four-layer architecture** in one repository — engine (`.claude/agents` and
  `.claude/commands`), contracts (`schemas/`), harness services (topic registry,
  knowledge graph, search, discovery), and outputs (`reports/`, channels, packs)
  — all shipping on clone. See
  [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-four-layer-single-repository-architecture.md).
- **MIF Level-3 I/O conformance**: findings are individual MIF memory units
  validated against the vendored `schemas/mif/` closure.
- **Goal-driven sessions**: a content-hashed, append-only goal
  (`schemas/goal.schema.json`) initiates, steers, and gates each run.
- **Config-declared dimensions** read from `harness.config.json` (`technical`,
  `landscape`, `trajectory`) — not a fixed taxonomy.
- **Single adversarial falsification gate** assigning ordinal verdicts
  (`falsified` / `weakened` / `survived` / `inconclusive`) with one-round
  remediation.
- **Packs and plugins**: one plugin per skill, toggled via the
  `harness.config.json` `packs[]` control plane and the
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` marketplace. Channel packs (book, Diátaxis,
  PDF, NotebookLM, GitHub Discussions, GitHub Issues), report genres,
  methodologies, and ontologies.
- **Output channels**: blog (first-class, always on) and the canonical MIF
  Level-3 report channel as the source of truth.
- **Diátaxis documentation set** under `docs/` (tutorials, how-to, reference,
  explanation) plus Architectural Decision Records under `docs/adr/`.
- **Attested delivery**: SHA-pinned GitHub Actions enforced by a `pin-check`
  CI gate, and a release workflow that attests a reproducible source tarball
  with SLSA build provenance via `actions/attest-build-provenance`.
- **Distribution** as a Copier living template and a Claude Code plugin
  marketplace.
