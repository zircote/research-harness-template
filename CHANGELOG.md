## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-23

First release of the domain-general research harness template.

### Added

- **Four-layer architecture** in one repository — engine (`.claude/agents` and
  `.claude/commands`), contracts (`schemas/`), harness services (topic registry,
  knowledge graph, search, discovery), and outputs (`reports/`, channels, packs)
  — all shipping on clone. See
  [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-four-layer-single-repository-architecture.md).
- **MIF Level-3 I/O conformance**: findings are individual MIF memory units
  validated against the vendored `schemas/mif/` closure.
- **Goal-driven sessions**: a content-hashed, append-only goal
  (`schemas/goal.schema.json`) initiates, steers, and gates each run.
- **Config-declared dimensions** read from `harness.config.json` (`technical`,
  `landscape`, `trajectory`) — not a fixed taxonomy.
- **Single adversarial falsification gate** assigning ordinal verdicts
  (`falsified` / `weakened` / `survived` / `inconclusive`) with one-round
  remediation.
- **Packs and plugins**: one plugin per skill, toggled via the
  `harness.config.json` `packs[]` control plane and the
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` marketplace. Channels (blog, book, Diátaxis,
  PDF, NotebookLM, GitHub), report genres, methodologies, and ontologies.
- **Output channels**: blog (first-class, always on) and the canonical MIF
  Level-3 report channel as the source of truth.
- **Diátaxis documentation set** under `docs/` (tutorials, how-to, reference,
  explanation) plus Architectural Decision Records under `docs/adr/`.
- **Attested delivery**: SHA-pinned GitHub Actions enforced by a `pin-check`
  CI gate, and a release workflow that attests a reproducible source tarball
  with SLSA build provenance via `actions/attest-build-provenance`.
- **Distribution** as a Copier living template and a Claude Code plugin
  marketplace.
